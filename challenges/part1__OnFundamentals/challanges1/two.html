        Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
        improve it.
        Your tasks:
        1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
        is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
        2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
        BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
        Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰
