        LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions
        1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
        called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
        returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
        represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
        the world population
        2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
        and then multiply by 100
        3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
        store the results into variables, and log them to the console
        4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
        'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
        the same populations)
        */
        // Function declaration
        function percentageOfWorld1(population){
            const percentage = (population/7900)*100
            const result = `China has ${population} million people, so its about ${percentage} of the worlds population`
            console.log(result)
            return result
        }
        percentageOfWorld1(1441)

        // Function Expression
        const percentageOfWorld2 = function(population){
            const percentage = (population/7900)*100
            const res = `China has ${population} million people, so its about ${percentage} of the worlds population`
            console.log(res)
            return res
        }
        percentageOfWorld2(1441)

        const percentage3 = (population) => {
            const percentage = (1441/7900)*100
            const ress = `China has ${population} million people, so its about ${percentage} of the worlds population`
            console.log(ress)
        }
        percentage3(1441)

        // Function calling other Function
        function describePopulation(country, population){
            let abc = percentageOfWorld1(population)
            console.log(abc)
        }
        describePopulation("Finland", 1441)
        describePopulation("India", 1221)
        describePopulation("Japan", 1331)
