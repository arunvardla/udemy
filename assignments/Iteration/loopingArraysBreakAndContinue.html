        LECTURE: Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing
        1. Let's bring back the 'populations' array from a previous assignment
        2. Use a for loop to compute an array called 'percentages2' containing the
        percentages of the world population for the 4 population values. Use the
        function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier
        3. Confirm that 'percentages2' contains exactly the same values as the
        'percentages' array that we created manually in the previous assignment,
        and reflect on how much better this solution is
        */
       const populations = [10, 1441, 332, 83];
       const percentage2 = [];
       const percentageOfWorld1 = function(population){
        return population/7900 * 100;
       };
       for(let i = 0; i < populations.length; i++){
        const percentage = percentageOfWorld1(populations[i]);
        percentage2.push(percentage);
       }
       
       console.log(percentage2);
