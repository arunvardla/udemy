        LECTURE: Iteration: The for Loop
        1. There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters.
        Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to
        the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting'
        */

        for(let voter = 1; voter <= 50; voter++){
