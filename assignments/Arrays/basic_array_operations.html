    LECTURE: Basic Array Operations (Methods)
    1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your
    choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array
    into a variable called 'neighbours'
    2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of
    your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array
    3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from
    the end of the array
    4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country ‘Germany’, log to the
    console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'
    5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the
    index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to
    change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for
    'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.

    const neighbors = ['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Russia'];  //1
    neighbors.push('Utopia') //2
    neighbors.pop();    //3
    if(!neighbors.includes('Germany')){             //4
        console.log('Probably not a central European country :D');
    }
    neighbors[neighbors.indexOf('Sweden')] = 'Republic of Sweden' //5
    console.log(neighbors)
