        LECTURE: The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
        1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator
        to log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'.
        Otherwise, simply log 'Portugal's population is below average'. Notice how only
        one word changes between these two sentences!
        2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
        130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
        */
        let country = "Portugal";
        let population = 10;
        console.log(`${country}'s population is ${population > 30 ? 'above' : 'below'} average`);
