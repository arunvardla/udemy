        LECTURE: Object Methods
        1. Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method
        will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous
        assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword.
        2. Call the 'describe' method
        3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This
        method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'.
        'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if
        there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.
