        1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the
        console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries
        and a capital called Helsinki.'
        2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then
        decrease it by two million using brackets notation.
